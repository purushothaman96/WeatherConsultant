# Weather Consultant
This project is to showcase my learning with UIPathStudio to build a robot.

The weather consultant robot will display the weather and temperature in a particular city entered by the user and suggest type of cloth to wear.

List of things learnt in building this robot:
* Sequence activity
* Flowchart activity
* Input dialog
* Using Variables
* Web scraping
* Flowchart conditional flow
* Using `OR` condition in if statement
* Message box
* String concatenation
* Debugging the process
